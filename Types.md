Here we are discussing about the Types that can be primitive or reference types.
- Primitive: Which can be assigned memoy on it's own.
- Reference: Which needs to assign the memory in the runtime by using the new keyword.
- We in general store the reference or the pointer to that location of the variable.
- It will be dependent on the address at which the variable is stored.
